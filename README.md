# FocusTime - Long-Term Project Tracker

A modern React application designed to help you track time spent on tasks and projects that span days, weeks, or months. Perfect for students, developers, and anyone working on long-term goals where traditional hour-based tracking falls short.

## Why FocusTime?

Most time trackers focus on hours and minutes, but real projects like:
- **Reading books** (e.g., "Finish Frankenstein")
- **Learning new skills** (e.g., "Master React")
- **Building projects** (e.g., "Create portfolio website")
- **Writing content** (e.g., "Complete research paper")

...take days or weeks to complete. FocusTime is built specifically for these long-term endeavors.
